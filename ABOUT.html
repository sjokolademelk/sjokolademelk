         <h1> ABOUT US </h1> 
        <p>Hello gorgeous! <br><img src="girlsign.png" width="100"><img src="girlsign.png" width="100"><img src="girlsign.png" width="100"><img src="girlsign.png" width="100"> <br>  We are four norwegian girls who loves fashion, shopping and most importantly: the environment!Unfortunately, the fashion industry is one of the most polluting idustries in the world. So how do we manage to live our "passion for fashion" and look out for the environment at the same time?<br>For starters, many of us throw away perfectly fine clothes because weÂ´re tired of them, and then we buy new clothing items. But what better way to give your old clothes a new home instead of throwing them in the garbage, and buy "new", used ones for a cheaper price? And better yet, doing something nice for the environment at the same time! <br><br> Happy shopping, <br> xx<br> second hand gang <br> </p>
